What is the role of ice shelves in stabilizing glaciers?|They have no impact on glacier stability,They prevent glacier melt by insulating ice below,They provide a barrier against warm ocean currents, slowing glacier flow,They accelerate glacier flow by lubricating the base with meltwater|3
How does glacier retreat impact freshwater availability?|It increases freshwater availability due to increased melting,It decreases freshwater availability as glaciers disappear,It has no effect on freshwater availability,It creates seasonal fluctuations in freshwater availability|2
What is the significance of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet?|It is the largest ice sheet in the world,It has no impact on global sea levels,It is considered more vulnerable to collapse than other ice sheets,It is located in the Arctic region|3
How do glacier meltwater inputs affect ocean circulation?|They increase ocean salinity, leading to changes in circulation patterns,They decrease ocean salinity, leading to changes in circulation patterns,They have no effect on ocean circulation,They create turbulence in coastal areas, affecting local currents|1
What is glacier erosion?|The buildup of sediment around glaciers,The process of glaciers carving out valleys and shaping the landscape,The melting of glaciers due to warmer temperatures,The movement of glaciers downhill|2
How does glacier melt impact local ecosystems?|It enhances biodiversity by creating new habitats,It disrupts ecosystems by altering water availability,It has no impact on local ecosystems,It accelerates plant growth due to increased water availability|2
What is the difference between a piedmont glacier and a valley glacier?|Piedmont glaciers are found in valleys, while valley glaciers flow out onto plains,Piedmont glaciers are found in valleys, while valley glaciers flow out onto plains,Piedmont glaciers are larger than valley glaciers,Valley glaciers are steeper than piedmont glaciers|1
How does glacier melt contribute to the release of stored greenhouse gases?|It has no impact on greenhouse gas emissions,It releases methane trapped in ice, contributing to warming,It increases the uptake of carbon dioxide by surrounding vegetation,It reduces atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases|2
What role do cryoconites play in glacier melting?|They accelerate glacier melting by absorbing more sunlight,They inhibit glacier melting by reflecting sunlight,They have no effect on glacier melting,They provide nutrients to algae, which darken the ice and increase melting|1
How does glacier melt contribute to the destabilization of slopes?|It stabilizes slopes by reducing the weight of ice,It destabilizes slopes by increasing water infiltration and triggering landslides,It has no impact on slope stability,It promotes vegetation growth, which anchors slopes and prevents erosion|2
