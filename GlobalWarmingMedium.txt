What is glacier calving?|The melting of glaciers due to volcanic activity,The process of glaciers melting at their base,The breaking off of icebergs from glaciers into water bodies,The formation of crevasses in glaciers|3
Which glacier is the largest contributor to rising sea levels?|Fox Glacier,Perito Moreno Glacier,Jakobshavn Glacier,Franz Josef Glacier|3
What is a glacier's "mass balance"?|The total volume of ice in a glacier,The ratio of ice accumulation to ice loss over time,The movement of a glacier downhill,The speed at which a glacier melts|2
How does glacier meltwater contribute to river flow?|It decreases river flow due to reduced precipitation,It increases river flow during the summer months,It has no effect on river flow,It increases river flow during the winter months|2
What is a moraine?|A type of glacier,A large body of water formed by glacier melt,A deposit of sediment carried and deposited by a glacier,A crevasse formed on the surface of a glacier|3
What is an iceberg?|A type of glacier found in Antarctica,A large chunk of floating ice that has broken off from a glacier,A deposit of sediment left behind by a glacier,A crevasse filled with water on a glacier's surface|2
How does the albedo effect contribute to glacier melt?| It decreases glacier melt by reflecting sunlight away from the surface,It accelerates glacier melt by absorbing more sunlight on dark surfaces,It has no effect on glacier melt,It causes glacier melt to fluctuate seasonally|2
What is the significance of the Greenland Ice Sheet?|It is the largest glacier in the world,It contains a significant portion of Earth's freshwater,It has no impact on global climate,It is located in Antarctica|2
What is the "ice-albedo feedback" mechanism?|A process where ice reflects sunlight, reducing temperatures,A feedback loop where melting ice reduces reflectivity, leading to further warming,A mechanism where ice formation is enhanced by warmer temperatures,A process where glaciers expand due to increased precipitation|2
What are glacier surges?|Periods of rapid glacier retreat,Sudden movements of glacier ice downslope,Large-scale melting events on glaciers,Cyclic changes in glacier volume|2
