What is phenology?|The study of the structure of ecosystems,The study of the seasonal timing of biological events,The study of species interactions in ecosystems,The study of genetic diversity within species|2
What is one potential consequence of species range shifts?|Increased competition among species,Reduced biodiversity,Enhanced ecosystem stability,Decreased habitat fragmentation|1
How does climate change influence species phenology?|By reducing the frequency of extreme weather events,By accelerating the timing of biological events such as migration and flowering,By promoting species adaptation to stable environmental conditions,By increasing habitat connectivity for migratory species|2
What is the term for the process by which ecosystems become more similar in species composition over time?|Ecosystem restoration,Habitat fragmentation,Biodiversity loss,Ecological homogenization|4
What is one strategy to mitigate the impacts of habitat loss and fragmentation on biodiversity?|Urbanization,Reforestation efforts,Exotic species introduction,Habitat destruction|2
How do corridors contribute to biodiversity conservation?|By promoting habitat fragmentation,By creating barriers to species movement,By providing connectivity between fragmented habitats,By reducing genetic diversity within populations|3
What is the difference between primary and secondary succession?|Primary succession occurs after secondary succession,Secondary succession occurs on barren surfaces with no soil,Primary succession occurs in disturbed areas with existing soil,Secondary succession occurs on stable, undisturbed surfaces|3
What role do apex predators play in maintaining ecosystem balance?|They have no impact on ecosystem balance,They regulate prey populations and prevent overgrazing,They compete with other species for resources,They promote invasive species colonization|2
How can habitat fragmentation affect species diversity?|By reducing competition among species,By increasing habitat connectivity,By isolating populations and reducing gene flow,By promoting species invasion|3
What is one potential consequence of increased urbanization on biodiversity?|Enhanced habitat connectivity,Reduced pollution levels,Loss of natural habitats and species diversity,Increased genetic diversity within populations|3
