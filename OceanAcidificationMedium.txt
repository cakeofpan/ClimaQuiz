Explain the chemical process behind ocean acidification.|Conversion of carbon dioxide into oxygen by marine plants,Absorption of carbon dioxide by the ocean, forming carbonic acid,Release of sulfur dioxide from volcanic eruptions,Decomposition of organic matter on the ocean floor|2
How does ocean acidification affect the growth of phytoplankton?|Stimulates their growth,Inhibits their growth,Has no effect on their growth,Causes them to migrate to deeper waters|2
Describe the potential consequences of ocean acidification on fisheries and aquaculture.|Increased fish populations,Decreased fish populations and economic losses for aquaculture,Expansion of aquaculture industries,No impact on fisheries and aquaculture|2
How does ocean acidification interact with other environmental stressors, such as warming temperatures?|It mitigates the effects of warming temperatures,It amplifies the effects of warming temperatures,It has no interaction with warming temperatures,It reverses the effects of warming temperatures|2
Discuss the role of ocean currents in spreading acidity throughout the oceans.|Ocean currents have no effect on ocean acidity,Ocean currents transport carbon dioxide to deeper waters, increasing acidity,Ocean currents reduce acidity by mixing surface and deep waters,Ocean currents only affect acidity near coastlines|2
What are some indirect effects of ocean acidification on marine food webs?|Increased diversity of plankton species,Disruption of predator-prey relationships,Expansion of coral reef ecosystems,Improved reproductive success of marine mammals|2
How might ocean acidification impact the dissolution of carbonate sediments?|Accelerate the dissolution of carbonate sediments,Have no effect on carbonate sediments,Increase the formation of carbonate sediments,Prevent the formation of carbonate sediments|1
Explain the concept of "biological pumps" and their connection to ocean acidification.|Biological pumps regulate ocean acidity by removing excess carbon dioxide,Biological pumps transport nutrients from deep to surface waters,Biological pumps regulate ocean temperatures,Biological pumps are not related to ocean acidification|1
How does ocean acidification influence the behavior and physiology of marine organisms?|It enhances their reproductive rates,It reduces their metabolic rates,It increases their tolerance to environmental stress,It disrupts their sensory cues and navigation abilities|4
Discuss potential mitigation strategies for addressing ocean acidification on a global scale.|Enhancing deforestation efforts,Increasing ocean desalination projects,Implementing carbon capture and storage technologies,Expanding fossil fuel extraction|3
