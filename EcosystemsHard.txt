What is one strategy to enhance ecosystem resilience to climate change?|Promoting monoculture farming,Implementing strict conservation measures,Accelerating habitat destruction,Eliminating apex predators|2
How does climate change influence species extinction rates?|By reducing extinction rates due to increased adaptation opportunities,By accelerating extinction rates due to habitat loss and fragmentation,By promoting species range shifts and increasing biodiversity,By decreasing extinction rates due to enhanced resource availability|2
What is a trophic cascade?|A process where changes in one trophic level cause ripple effects throughout an ecosystem,A sudden extinction event of multiple species in an ecosystem,A cycle of nutrient recycling in aquatic ecosystems,A phenomenon where invasive species outcompete native species for resources|1
How does habitat fragmentation affect genetic diversity within populations?|It increases genetic diversity by promoting gene flow between populations,It decreases genetic diversity by isolating populations and reducing gene flow,It has no impact on genetic diversity within populations,It enhances genetic diversity by accelerating mutation rates|2
What is an ecological niche?|A specific geographic location within an ecosystem,The sum of a species' interactions with other organisms and its physical environment,The process of competition between species for limited resources,The study of species interactions and their effects on ecosystem dynamics|2
How does habitat loss impact ecosystem functioning?|It enhances ecosystem stability by reducing species diversity,It disrupts ecosystem functioning by altering nutrient cycling and energy flow,It promotes ecosystem resilience by creating new habitats for species colonization,It has no impact on ecosystem functioning|2
What is one method used to assess biodiversity in an ecosystem?|Counting the number of invasive species present,Conducting genetic analyses of a single species,Measuring species richness and evenness,Observing changes in ecosystem productivity|3
How do species interactions influence ecosystem dynamics?|By promoting species competition and reducing biodiversity,By altering nutrient cycling and energy flow within ecosystems,By accelerating habitat destruction and fragmentation,By promoting species extinction and reducing ecosystem stability|2
What is the role of ecosystem engineers in shaping habitats?|They have no impact on habitat structure,They accelerate habitat destruction by altering natural processes,They create, modify, or maintain habitats for other species,They promote species invasion by outcompeting native species|3
What is one potential consequence of altered precipitation patterns on biodiversity?|Enhanced habitat connectivity,Increased species diversity,Changes in species distributions and community composition,Reduced competition among species|3
